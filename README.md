üî•üî•üî• [2024/10/28] We released **CGM**, mainly for repository-level coding tasks.

## Introduction
We propose a graph-based framework CGM for real-world SE tasks. Before CGM starts its work, we construct a repository-level code graph to better represent the repository context and its structure by Code Graph Generator. Inspired by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, CGM framework is designed as a chain structure consisting of four atomic nodes, termed as R4 (Rewriter, Retriever, Reranker, and Reader) chain for this scenario. Given an issue, the initial input to the CGM framework includes the issue description and the corresponding code graph. Rewriter will first rewrite the original issue by extracting keywords and generating relevant queries for code graph. Then a heuristic code subgraph is retrieved through Retriever based on the matching anchor nodes from rewriter output. Given that the resulting subgraph provides a relatively broad context necessary for reference, we need a Reranker to identify the files most likely to be modified as a further hint. Subsequently, both the retrieved subgraph and the identified files are input into a trainable, graph-based Reader to generate the corresponding code patch.

### Framework

![Framework](./assets/cgm_framework_0123.png)

### Highlights
:white_check_mark: **Code Graph**: Train models on multiple tasks while maintaining a balance between them. The models can even generalize to new, previously unseen tasks.

:white_check_mark: **Multi-framework**: It provides support for both Accelerate (with Deepspeed and FSDP)

:white_check_mark: **Efficient fine-tuning**: It supports LoRA, QLoRA as well as Full-parameters training, enabling fine-tuning of large models with minimal resources. The training speed meets the demands of almost all fine-tuning scenarios.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Required Packages

```bash
transformers==4.46.1
tokenizers==0.20.0
accelerate==1.0.1
peft==0.13.2
jinja2==2.11.3
fuzzywuzzy==0.18.0
python-Levenshtein==0.25.1
networkx==3.0
```

## Usage

### Rewriter
Use function ```generate_prompt_for_extractor``` and ```generate_prompt_for_inferer``` in ```rewriter/prompt.py```
```python
def generate_prompt_for_extractor(problem_statement, repo_name):
    prompt = """
    <issue>
    {}
    </issue> 
    This is an issue related to repository '{}'. 
    Instructions:
    1. Analysis:
    ‚óã Analyze the provided issue description. Identify the relevant File, Class, or Function involved.
    ‚óã Determine the specific problem or error encountered and note any clues that may assist in locating the relevant or problematic area.
    2. Extraction:
    ‚óã After the analysis, extract ALL the mentioned code entities (File, Class, or Function), especially Files.
    ‚óã Then extract three potential and meaningful keywords, responding in the following format:

    [start_of_analysis] 
    <detailed_analysis> 
    [end_of_analysis] 

    [start_of_related_code_entities] 
    <entity_name_with_path>
    [end_of_related_code_entities] 

    [start_of_related_keywords] 
    <keywords>
    [end_of_related_keywords]

    Notes:
    - Pay attention to the information in the error logs (if exists).
    - The buggy code exists solely in the project described in the issue (e.g., django, sklearn). Buggy location is usually not in the tests files or external packages.
    - Your extracted entities should be CONCISE, ACCURATE and INFORMATIVE.
    - Provide the relative path for code entities if specified (e.g., package/foo.py). Relative path is relative to the repository itself, do not include suffix like '/home/username/', '/etc/service/' or '/tree/master'.
    - Do not include any additional information such as line numbers or explanations in your extraction result.

    Preferred extraction Examples of Code Entities:
    - repo/cart.py
    - Class User()
    - def getData()
    Preferred extraction Examples of Keywords:
    - train_loop
    - hooks
    - docker
    
    Unpreferred extraction Examples of keywords:
    - something wrong
    - input validation
    - TypeError
    """.format(problem_statement, repo_name)
        
    return prompt

def generate_prompt_for_inferer(problem_statement, repo_name):
    prompt = """
    <issue>
    {}
    </issue> 
    This is an issue related to repository '{}'. 
    Task:
    Based on the issue description provided, identify the characteristics of code entities (files, functions, class) that might need to be modified. 
    For each characteristic, generate a search query that could help locate relevant code entities in a codebase.
    Instructions:
    First, analyze the issue description and identify keywords, features, and functionalities that are likely relevant to the modification of code entities.
    Then, create queries that capture these characteristics, focusing on:
    ‚óè File names that may implement relevant functionalities.
    ‚óè Functions or methods that are related to the features described in the issue.
    ‚óè Any patterns or structures that might be relevant to the functionalities mentioned.
    For example:
    ‚óè File related to the initialization of a neural network.
    ‚óè Function related to the training process.
    ‚óè Code used to configure the service.
    Please answer in the following format:

    [start_of_analysis] 
    <detailed_analysis> 
    [end_of_analysis] 

    [start_of_related_queries] 
    query 1:
    query 2:
    ...
    [end_of_related_queries] 

    Notes:
    - Your queries should be DETAILED, ACCURATE and INFORMATIVE. 
    - Your queries should be a complete sentences and do not include additional explanation.
    - The number of queries is up to five, so be focus on the important characteristics.
    - Your queries should focus on the repository code itself, rather than other information like commit history.
    - Pay attention to the information in the error logs (if exists).

    Preferred Query Examples:
    - Look for references to "tqdm" or "progress_bar" within the training loop files to find where progress bars are currently updated.
    - Code snippets where 'gethostbyname' function from 'socket' module is called.
    - File name containing 'mysql.py' AND functions related to 'MySQLStatementSamples' initialization.
    - Functions or methods handling hostname resolution or encoding within 'datadog_checks' directory.
    - Find all occurrences of "early_stopping" within files that also mention "Trainer" to identify where early stopping logic is implemented and potentially needs adjustment for non-default 'val_check_interval'.

You can use the rewriter prompt by
```python
from rewriter.prompt import generate_prompt_for_extractor, generate_prompt_for_inferer

# Generate extraction prompt
extraction_prompt = generate_prompt_for_extractor(problem_statement, repo_name)

# Generate inference prompt
inference_prompt = generate_prompt_for_inferer(problem_statement, repo_name)
```

### Retriever
The Retriever module consists of two main components:

1. ```locate.py``` - Anchor Node Identification
   
Identifies relevant anchor nodes in the code graph based on Rewriter output.

2. ```subgraph.py``` - Relevant Subgraph Extraction

Extracts relevant subgraph around the identified anchor nodes.

### Reranker
Use function ```generate_prompt_for_reranker_stage_1``` and ```generate_prompt_for_reranker_stage_2``` in ```reranker/prompt.py```
```python

You are an experienced software developer who specializes in assessing the relevance of the file for solving the issue in software repositories.

Task:
For a file provided, evaluate the likelihood that modifying this file would resolve the given issue, and assign a score based on specific criteria.

Instructions:
1. Analysis:
- Analyze the provided issue description and the content of the single relevant file, pay attention to any keywords, error messages, or specific functionalities mentioned that relate to the file.
- Determine how closely the contents and functionality of the file are tied to the problem or error described in the issue.
- Consider the role of the file in the overall project structure (e.g., configuration files, core logic files versus test files, or utility scripts).
2. Scoring:
- Based on your analysis, assign a score from 1 to 5 that represents the relevance of modifying the given file in order to solve the issue.

Score Specifications:
1. **Score 1**: The file is almost certainly unrelated to the issue, with no apparent connection to the functionality or error described in the issue.
2. **Score 2**: The file may be tangentially related, but modifying it is unlikely to resolve the issue directly; possible in rare edge cases.
3. **Score 3**: The file has some relevance to the issue; it might interact with the affected functionality indirectly and tweaking it could be part of a broader fix.
4. **Score 4**: The file is likely related to the issue; it includes code that interacts directly with the functionality in question and could plausibly contain bugs that lead to the issue.
5. **Score 5**: The file is very likely the root cause or heavily involved in the issue and modifying it should directly address the error or problem mentioned.

Respond in the following format:
[start_of_analysis]
<detailed_analysis>
[end_of_analysis]

[start_of_score]
Score <number>
[end_of_score]

Notes:
- The content of the file shows only the structure of this file, including the names of the classes and functions defined in this file.
- You can refer to to the information in the error logs (if exists).
